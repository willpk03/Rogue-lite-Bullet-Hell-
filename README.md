<h2>Rogue-lite-Bullet-Hell-</h2> 
This is a project created to test an idea of creating an arcade game with a slight touch of roguelite aspect of slowly going in and out of a dungeon upgrading your character before each entry into the 'dungeon'. 

<h3> How it was designed</h3>
The idea of how to develop it was by seperating the system in too the two parts. Each time you'd die the player would be sent back to the 'store' page where they would have all their stats and credits reset. Later on, the credits were decided to be equal to the player's current high score. 
From here the plan was to set up a system that could be easily duplicated for any other stat I had in mind or to allow modifications to the bullet type and or player character.

From here on the main page, I wanted to make sure that it was simple to create a new enemy that could randomly be picked to start attacking the player. With this, I was able to check what level it was and then provide a random number that would signify what enemy type. Enemy types were all stored on the player controller.
